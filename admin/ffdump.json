          "content": "# Tales of Fantasy and Fighting\n\nThis is a pretty general RPG designed to replace Dungeons and Dragons, Pathfinder, Savage Worlds, or any of those other rules sets. The game itself aims to have a streamlined set of rules which are expressive and somewhat realistic, but ultimately a cinematic / four-color style of play with superhuman feats of adventure and excitement.\n\n# The Core Mechanic\n\nEvery role-playing game needs a mechanic for resolving player actions. In the Tales system, dice rolls are used. In this system, all actions are resolved in approximately the same fashion, whether they are in combat or out of combat.\n\nAs a player, you roll all the dice. The Game Master doesn't - they will set difficulty thresholds for anything you want to do, be that picking a lock on the cage of a captive animal or punching an animal you just freed or avoiding the swift and terrible claws of the animal you just punched.\n\nWhen you attempt to do something, the GM will set a difficulty threshold (typically between 1 and 20) and tell you what sort of task you are attempting. As a player, you should then:\n\n1. Clarify the sort of task, negotiating with the GM what sort of skill and attribute are in play. The GM will usually give you guidance as to the attribute type (physical or mental), although sometimes they may specify a specific attribute or leave it entirely unspecified, and the related skill (such as Perception or Dry Science Knowledge). The GM will also usually give you a target number, ranging from 1 (trivial) to 20 (nigh impossible).\n\n2. Based on the skill for the roll, you will start with some number of twelve-sided dice to roll, and adjust that based on assets and hindrances. Start with:\n\n    1. Three dice, taking the worst roll if you are **inept**\n\n    2. Two dice, taking the worse roll if you are **unskilled**\n\n    3. One die if you are **proficient**\n\n    4. Two dice, taking the better if you are **trained**\n\n    5. Three dice, taking the best if you are **expert**\n\n3. You may possess some **assets **to help you in your skill - you may have at most one mental and one physical asset for any given check. Each asset provides one extra die to roll (or removes one of the penalty dice if you are unskilled or inept).\n\n4. The Game Master may apply any number of **hindrances **to your check - reasons why this particular check is more difficult than usual. Each hindrance reduces the number of dice rolled by one - adding to penalty dice if it takes your count below 1.\n\n5. If you possess **edge**** **in the attribute you're rolling, add that to your roll. Edge is free and automatically applies to all rolls on the attribute for which you have edge.\n\n6. If you have access to **situational edge** from some source (usually equipment or an upgrade) for a given skill, add that amount to your roll.\n\n7. You may deduct points from the relevant attribute pool to improve your total. Increase your roll by 1 for each point of pool you spend. Improving this way is called **effort**. (\"I use three effort to increase the roll from 3 to 6\")\n\n8. Compare the total to the difficulty.\n\n    6. If your total is below the difficulty, you failed.\n\n    7. If your total is equal to or above the difficulty, you succeeded.\n\n9. If you succeeded and your die roll was a 12, you may spend 3 additional pool to convert your success into a critical success. This has some extra benefit- you dodged out of the way so quickly, the animal you freed and subsequently punched became unbalanced and fell over, or you hacked the security so well that you left a back door for future use. Propose the outcome, and the GM will approve it or negotiate.\n\n# Attributes\n\nThere are five attributes in the Tales system: Might, Speed, Focus, Conviction, and Health. The first four attributes are sometimes referred to as **Core **attributes.\n\n* **Might **represents raw physical strength.\n\n* **Speed **represents actual speed as well as dexterity and reflexes.\n\n* **Focus **represents how well your character can think about something in the face of distraction or quickly come to some kind of insight.\n\n* **Conviction **represents the strength of your character's belief in something. Themselves, a higher power, Science, or any other ideal.\n\n* **Health **represents your character's overall health, and is only used when your character might become wounded or killed (falling from a great height, being shot, accidentally touching the wrong wire when disabling door security).\n\nYour attributes each have three values associated with them: **pool**, **edge**, and **refresh**.\n\n## Pool\n\nThe **pool** value is the primary and most important number - ranging usually from 5 to 30, it represents how much endurance your character has for using that attribute. As you make action checks, you may spend pool to increase your roll total or to activate a critical success.\n\nNote your character's maximum and current pool values - your attribute pool will be temporarily decreased when you spend points, and will be refreshed when you get a chance to rest, but you can never refresh the pool beyond its maximum value. That maximum value can, however, be increased by spending XP.\n\n## Edge\n\nMost characters have a small **edge** value for some of their attributes, which represent some raw, above-average ability with that attribute. The edge value is added to every roll you make with that attribute. Edge values are set during character creation, and do not change much during play.\n\n## Refresh\n\nThe attribute refresh value is how much it regenerates between scenes. The GM will note when a scene is over (after a combat or other extended encounter). At that point, the characters have a chance to rest and recuperate, increasing each attribute pool by its refresh.\n\nThe baseline attribute refresh value for all five attributes is ceiling(max_pool / 5). A pool of 5 has a refresh of 1, whereas a pool of 6 has a refresh of 2. Characters can gain bonus refresh from both temporary and permanent sources.\n\n## Which Pool to Use?\n\nEach skill your character has is tied to one or more attributes. When the GM asks you to make a skill check, you should choose the attribute at the time you make the roll. The description of how your character approaches using this skill should help justify the choice of attribute. \n\nThe distinction within physical attributes is usually pretty intuitive - are you dodging nimbly out of the way, or aggressively blocking the attack with a shield? With mental attributes, the guideline is: use Focus if the action is taking place over a relatively long time (minutes or more) and Conviction if it is a quick action. Conviction is more about belief in oneself (or a higher power), whereas Focus is just that - the ability to maintain focus and precision over an extended length of time.\n\nFinally, there may be situations where a non-standard attribute is called for either by the GM or the player. As an example, while characters typically use Might or Speed on melee weapon rolls, a focus-based weapon skill check might be appropriate for sharpening an axe, or a conviction-based one comparing the relative utility of two different axes.\n\n# Character Species\n\nIn High Fantasy campaigns, there are plenty of Species or Races to choose from. You could play a doughty dwarven warrior or a fey woodland sprite. In the Tales system, these choices are expressed entirely via the normal character creation process: build your character, and tell the story you want to tell with those numbers. If your high-might character is an Orcish wanderer, cool. If they are instead an uncharacteristically strong Hobbit, you're fine. The story you tell is entirely up to you, and the point of a Fantasy game is not to perpetuate any old-fashioned racist tropes about Orcs and Elves.\n\n# Using Skills\n\nWhen it is time for your character to try something that might not succeed, the GM will call for a Skill check, giving the players a skill to check and a target number to check against (e.g., \"make a Movement check with a target of 8 to scale the wall\".)\n\nAll skills have an **initial rating** indicating the character's proficiency. Characters start with an initial rating of 0 in Health Defense, a rating of 0 (proficient) in four skills of your choice, and -2 (inept) in four skills of your choice. The rest are -1 (unskilled).\n\nOnce the base number of dice to roll is set, the player may add up to two **assets** to the roll, if the GM allows it. These assets represent some kind of specific and contextual advantage the character has in the situation. The character may have practice picking a particular brand of locks, impersonating a specific person, or have a tactical advantage flanking their foe with an ally.\n\nThe GM may also apply any number of **hindrances** to your check as well, representing reasons why this check is more difficult than usual. The GM also could adjust the difficulty of your roll, but the difficulty of a task is usually fixed (this lock requires a check of 10 to pick, but you have two hindrances because it's raining and there's a fight going on around you and distracting you). \n\nEach asset adds 1 to the skill rating for the roll, and each hindrance subtracts 1. This final value is known as the **adjusted skill rating**, and indicates how many dice you should roll for the check. \n\nRoll 1d12 plus an additional dice equal to the absolute value of the ASR, taking either the highest (if the ASR is positive), or the lowest (if it is negative) value as the final result.\n\nExample: Both Bill and Ted are attempting to climb a wall, with target 8. Bill is proficient in the movement skill (rating 0), and Ted is inept (-2). The knotted rope they use to help climb the wall provides an asset to the roll. Therefore the ASR for the tests are 1 for Bill and -1 for Ted. Each player will roll two 12-sided dice, but Bill's player takes the higher of the two, and Ted's the lower of the two.\n\nThe result showing on the selected die (all checks only ever end up selecting a single die) is called the **rolled result**, and is always a number between 1 and 12. This result is then adjusted in two ways. First: add any edge that applies to this roll. Characters all have an edge in one or more attributes that applies to all rolls made using that attribute. Second: some characters will have equipment or powers that provide situational edge, a bonus on only certain kinds of checks. If they apply, add that number here. Unless otherwise noted, a character can only apply situational edge from one source.\n\nIf the rolled result is a natural 12, the player may opt to spend 3 pool from the rolled attribute in order to upgrade their roll to a **critical success**. A critical success has many possible outcomes - it usually will disable or kill minion-type foes in combat in a single hit, will automatically wound major foes, and will have some kind of highly useful outcome for non-combat skills (not just picking the lock, but gaining a permanent asset on locks in the same dungeon, etc).\n\nFinally, no matter what the result is, the player can spend any amount of remaining pool they have in their attribute to increase the roll result by 1 per pool spent. Thus, if the target was 10 and the rolled result an 8, spending 2 pool after rolling will ensure success. \n\n## Non-combat Skills\n\nNon-combat skills are so named because they are not used to resolve combat actions.

These weapon types (greataxe, longbow, etc) are all advisory; if your character has a great reason to use a rapier with their Melee Conviction skill, the GM may allow it. \n\nThese following basic attack, defense, and initiative skills can be used by anyone (even untrained). Other, more esoteric skills (such as advanced unarmed combat or psionic defense) are only available if the relevant upgrade has been purchased.\n\n<table>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Attribute</td>\n    <td>Melee</td>\n    <td>Ranged</td>\n    <td>Defense</td>\n    <td>Initiative</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Might</td>\n    <td>Bashing\n(Greataxe, Greatsword, Polearms</td>\n    <td>Hurling\nJavelin, Large Rocks, Longbow</td>\n    <td>Toughness</td>\n    <td>N/A</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Speed</td>\n    <td>Fencing\nDaggers, Quarterstaff, Rapier, Light Mace</td>\n    <td>Quick Draw\nCrossbow, Rifle</td>\n    <td>Dodge</td>\n    <td>Reflexes</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Conviction</td>\n    <td>Righteous Fury\nGreataxe, Greatsword, Polearms</td>\n    <td>Hip Shot\nLongbow, Pistol, Hand Crossbow</td>\n    <td>Faith</td>\n    <td>Providence</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Focus</td>\n    <td>Combat Insight\nDaggers, Quarterstaff, Rapier, Light Mace</td>\n    <td>Sniper\nCrossbow, Rifle</td>\n    <td>Prediction</td>\n    <td>Tactics</td>\n  </tr>\n</table>\n\n\nSPECIAL: When choosing an initial four skills for a character to be inept in, if you choose a combat skill, you must choose an entire column (\"melee skills\" for example) as a single choice. Thus, such a character might be inept in all defenses, plus three other noncombat skills to be inept in. This choice is not recommended.\n\n### Defense Skills\n\nThere are five defense skills, one for each attribute. The four core attribute defense skills (might, speed, focus, conviction) represent avoidance of one form or another. With speed you would dodge out of the way, with might you would block or parry, with focus you simply know where to be so you will not be hit, and with conviction your belief in yourself (or a higher power) allows you to ignore the attack as it misses you.\n\nNote that this probably means a well-balanced character in a combat-heavy campaign will use one attribute for weapon skills and another for defense skills, in order to keep pool available for each use. It is also perfectly reasonable to vary which attribute a character is using for defense as they run low on pool in one attribute.\n\nFinally, health checks are a special case - all characters are proficient in health, and it is difficult to change that. Health checks represent the character actually taking some damage (rolling health defense is similar to taking Hit Point damage in other games). When an item or upgrade influences a character's \"defense\" rolls, that only applies to the core four defenses, and not to health checks unless explicitly called out.\n\n### Initiative\n\nInitiative is another special skill family, with three skills (there is no might-based initiative skill), but the sense of an initiative roll is reversed. The goal with initiative is to roll as low as possible (lower rolls act sooner), so a character with an ASL of 1 in an initiative skill would roll two dice and take the *lower* of the two values. Similarly, edge and pool lower the rolled result instead of increasing it (to a minimum value of 1). The reasoning for this kind of rolling is described in the [Turns in Combat](#heading=h.sbxi1nlgf8zc) section.\n\n## Acquiring Skills\n\nDuring advancement (and at other times), characters will learn new skills. In order to communicate initial skill rating, the following terms are used: inept: -2, unskilled: -1, proficient: 0, trained: 1, expert: 2. When an upgrade (or other source) says that your character becomes proficient in a skill, set that skill rating to 0, if that is higher than its current value. Thus, multiple sources of proficiency in the same skill do not combine with each other, and if one source gives trained and another proficient, the character is trained.\n\nIn the rare case where a character loses proficiency in a skill (due to injury or curse), again the proficiency level will be given, set the characters skill rating to the lower of their current value and the one given. Thus someone who is already inept is not harmed by a curse that causes them to become unskilled.\n\n# Special Combat Rules\n\nFor the most part, Combat is handled like any other scene - players take and resolve actions using rolls and pool, usually utilizing weapon and defense skills. The main difference is that combat actions are usually antagonistic - the NPC (or PC) foe is actively trying to cause your character to fail at their actions, so there are a few extra rules for resolving success and timing.\n\n## Combat against NPCs\n\nWhen fighting against an NPC, players make all the rolls. They roll to attack against the NPCs fixed defense score, and they roll to defend against the fixed attack score. \n\n### Attacking an NPC:\n\n1. Use an attack action, either just a regular attack with a weapon or a special skill. \n\n2. The GM will tell you what the difficulty of the attack is - most NPCs have uniform stats, but some are strong / weak to certain attack modes. \n\n3. Resolve your attack as usual, including effort. If successful, your attack does damage equal to the margin by which you succeeded, plus the damage statistic of your weapon.\n\n4. Most NPCs also have an armor value (different rules from the armor worn by PCs, but similar in use). Subtract that number from the damage calculated in step 3. If that number is zero or negative, no damage is done. Any combat ability that has a secondary effect (knocking prone, applying poison, etc) requires at least one point of damage to penetrate armor to be considered successful.\n\n5. All NPCs have a special health score (different from the health pool). Damage taken is deducted from this score. When it goes to zero, the NPC is disabled - unconscious or dying, depending on how the health was reduced.\n\n### Defending against an NPC attack:\n\n1. The GM will tell you the difficulty of defending against a foe. Make your check normally, with edge and effort, using a defense skill of your choice.\n\n2. If you succeeded, the attack failed to meaningfully connect. You dodged, parried, or just stood there and let the foe hit you while not even flinching.\n\n3. If your defense roll failed, the attack has hit you. You now must make a health check with a difficulty equal to the magnitude of your failure, plus the NPCs damage attribute. \n\n4. If your health check succeeds, the attack does minimal damage to you. You were grazed, took a flesh wound, shook it off, did that thing where you wipe some blood from the corner of your lip with the back of your hand and look determinedly at the camera. The magnitude of this damage is proportional to the amount of Health pool you needed to spend to succeed at the check.\n\n5. If your health check failed, you took a Serious Wound. One of your attributes is wounded, using these prioritization rules:\n\n    1. No attribute can be wounded more than once.\n\n    2. Wound the attribute you were using for avoidance (the roll in step 2)\n\n    3. Wound a different attribute that is not health.\n\n    4. Wound health.\n\n    5. Die (if your character already has wounded all four core attributes and Health and takes another wound, they die).\n\nSee below for more rules on health, wounds, and healing.\n\n## Ranged Combat\n\nWhen engaging in ranged combat (gun, crossbow, thrown dagger, etc), there are additional modifiers to combat.\n\n1. Combat takes place at three effective ranges: short, medium and long. These ranges aren't super-specific (this is not a tactical miniatures game), but roughly, short range is anywhere between 2 and 30 feet, medium is 30 to 100, and long is 100+ feet. There is also melee or immediate range, which is directly adjacent to you (point blank, in other words).\n\n2. When attacking a foe at medium range, apply one hindrance to the roll. Long range applies three hindrances.\n\n3. Scopes and aiming can remove hindrances (breaking the rule of stacking assets on a single roll), usually at the cost of increasing the initiative count for making the attack.\n\n4. Without a special ability, characters cannot use most ranged weapons in melee range.\n\n## Special rules for Major Foes and PvP combat\n\nA few special GM-run characters are Major Foes. They are the Arch-Nemesis, the Villain, or some other important character in the story, run by the GM, but still using full rules. Those characters should be treated as PCs played by the GM. Additionally, there may be occasional times when players wish to fight against each other (or do other hindering, non-combat, actions like try to hold closed a door another PC is trying to open). In those cases, the GM will designate one character as the *actor* and one as the *hinderer*. In combat, the attacker is the actor and the defender is the hinderer. In other situations it may be more fluid, but in general the actor should be the one trying to accomplish something and the hinderer the person preventing it.\n\n1. The actor declares what they are going to do: \"I make a speed attack using my rapier and special Dazzling Attack skill.\"\n\n2. The hinderer declares what they are going to do: \"I use my might to defend, catching the attack on my chitin shield.\"\n\n3. The actor rolls, spending effort as usual, but not against a target difficulty. They just attempt to roll as high as possible.\n\n4. The hinderer rolls, spending effort as usual. Their target is the actor's result. This means the hinderer knows ahead of time how much effort is needed to succeed.\n\n5. Whoever rolled highest wins, with a tie meaning the actor was successful.\n\n6. In combat, if the actor succeeds, their success margin is added to their damage attribute and the hinderer must make a health check as normal.\n\n7. Any secondary effects from a combat ability are applied if the actor succeeds.\n\n## Turns in Combat and other time-critical events\n\nWhen the order of turns matters, play happens in \"initiative order\". At the start of combat (or some other tense moment), the GM will call for an Initiative check. Initiative is a Quickness check (so most of the time, you can choose to roll Speed or Focus, but in special circumstances, the GM will restrict it to one or the other), and normal training, effort and edge rules apply. PCs start play as **untrained** in initiative, although many Upgrades grant proficiency or better.\n\nUnlike most rolls, with an Initiative roll, the goal is to roll low. So therefore, when selecting the better / worse of two rolls due to training, the better roll is lower. Additionally, edge and spent effort will reduce your Initiative roll instead of increasing it (to a minimum of 1). NPCs do not roll, but have fixed initiative values.\n\nDuring Initiative Time, the GM starts counting at the lowest initiative order, and players act on their turn. Each chunk of time is called a \"tick\", as in \"I act on tick two, and then Bob acts on tick three, right after me.\"\n\nWhen a player acts, they add the base time cost for their action, plus any effort spent on that action to their current initiative value to calculate the next initiative value. Example: Bob acts on tick three, swinging a sword (base six ticks), plus he spent three effort making sure he hit for significant damage. The extra windup means that he used nine ticks to attack, and will be able to act again on tick twelve.\n\nAll weapons have an initiative value, which is the base number of ticks it costs to attack with them. If you spend pool on an attack ability (rather than effort), this does not change the initiative cost of the attack (although many combat abilities have an initiative modifier built in - such as Swift Strike: spend 2 pool to make a normal attack with a -1 modifier to the initiative cost.)\n\nUnless otherwise noted, initiative cost can never be reduced below 1. In the event of a tie between characters at the same initiative value, the character who acted more recently goes last. If there is a tie at the start of combat when initiative is first determined, usually PCs will go before NPCs, unless there is some reason or GM intervention (such as an ambush).\n\n### Interrupt Actions\n\nSome actions, like actively blocking an attack, or jumping out of the way of an oncoming train, take place before you would normally act. Those actions might be granted directly by the GM (especially in the case of jumping out of the way), or may be part of your character's abilities (active blocking). In any case, you should declare the interrupt at the appropriate time, and add the initiative cost to your current count.\n\n*Example*: Stella the Warrior swings her sword on tick 2, which is a 6 tick action. Normally she would go again on tick 8, but on tick 5 a Bloodbeast attacked her friend with its claws. Stella uses her Shield Wall ability on tick 5 to block that attack, preventing Roger the Sorcerer from being eviscerated. This action has a 4 tick cost to it, so instead of going on tick 8, Stella will act again on tick 12. Before tick 12, Stella could use her Shield Wall ability again if she wanted, further bumping out her next available action into the future, until she ran out of Speed pool to pay for the Shield Wall action.\n\n### Hold Actions\n\nHold actions are the logical inverse of Interrupt actions. They must be declared on the acting player's turn, but will last an indefinite number of ticks until their prerequisite is satisfied, at which point they take place immediately, interrupting the triggering action. Any player can declare a held attack for certain circumstances, and some abilities provide additional hold actions.\n\n*Example*: After polishing off the last standing Bloodbeast, on Stella's next action she declares a Held Attack - she will swing her sword at the next hostile being to get close enough to hit. After four more ticks, another Bloodbeast charges into the fray, and Stella gets a chance to attack it before it can attack anyone. Once Stella's held action has resolved, her Initiative count resumes as normal (6 ticks after swinging at the charging Bloodbeast).\n\nA held action can be canceled at any time at the cost of 2 ticks - the player declares that they are canceling the hold, and can then act again as normal 2 ticks later.\n\n### Extended Actions\n\nNormally, when a character acts, the action is resolved immediately - you declare that you're attacking something and check to see if you succeed right then, and cannot act again for a little while. Some longer actions (such as hacking a terminal or administering first aid) should be declared on the character's turn, but only resolved after the initiative ticks have passed (so on tick 5, you state that you are picking a lock, which takes 10 ticks to attempt, and on tick 15 you roll to see if you are successful). The GM will rule whether any action is an extended action, but any initiative cost shown with an E is intended to be extended (I:4E vs I:4)\n\nAny pool spent during an extended action that is not spent on the action itself (such as defending yourself) increases the number of ticks needed to complete the action by a likewise amount. Any wound received during the extended action will interrupt the action, resulting in failure. In that case, the character can act again as normal two ticks after receiving the wound.\n\n# Health and Wounds\n\nThere are two situations which call for health defense rolls: being attacked in combat and being subject to some other damaging environmental effect (falling from a great height, eating questionable sushi, etc). In any case, the GM will ask you to make a health check with a given difficulty. Players start as proficient with Health checks, although some special cases may apply.\n\nIf you succeed at your health defense check, you are fine. Your character shrugged off whatever happened to them, and the only negative effect is possibly a reduction in health pool from effort, making them more likely to be wounded in the future.\n\nIf your character's health defense check failed, they have taken a wound. This is serious and has several in-game implications.\n\nEach attribute can only sustain one wound. If you already have taken five wounds (each core attribute, plus health) and take another wound, the character dies. \n\nWhen an attribute is wounded, the current pool for that attribute is immediately set to zero, and it cannot refresh during normal rest. Furthermore, a wound applies a hindrance to any checks made using that attribute.  The character should also show external effects of this wound - a gash in a large muscle group slowing them down, a solid blow to the head making them unfocused, or sprained or dislocated joints. \n\nCertain NPCs have special characteristics that increase the wounding capacity of their attacks, representing the significant danger of their weapons. The GM also has discretion to apply multiple wounds to a character at once due to an environmental effect (otherwise, PCs could leap from great height saying, \"it's okay, the system caps me at one wound, so I can't die!\"\n\nHowever, during normal play, wounds should be serious but not immediately fatal. The Tales system prioritizes storytelling over gritty action, and the death of a Player Character (or even Companion) should be the result of an epic story event, rather than a few unlucky rolls. \n\n# Scenes, Timing, and Recovery\n\nAs such, the action resolution mechanics are designed to get your character into and out of scrapes on a scene-by-scene basis. While your character may suffer lasting damage in the form of wounds, most of the time they will shrug off whatever happened last scene and be back in action as soon as the camera pans back to them again.\n\nThe central unit of timing in Tales is the Scene - this represents one thing that happens, and takes about 10-30 minutes of play to resolve. This may be one combat encounter, a protracted chase, or a tense negotiation with law enforcement. Most skills and equipment whose effect is not instantaneous has a duration of one Scene. This is mostly for quality of life, instead of tracking how many minutes it has been since the start of combat to find out if your jet boosters have run out of fuel, we can just say that they last for the scene. The duration of a Scene is at the discretion of the GM. Some tactical abilities used in combat have tick durations - five or ten ticks of an effect. If combat ends, those abilities end as well, even if there was duration left.\n\nIn between scenes, PCs pools will refresh by the refresh score in that pool. Your character's basic refresh score is a function of max pool in that attribute, but it can be increased from that base temporarily or permanently by gizmos, equipment, and upgrades.\n\nWounds are harder to heal. Once per day, you can heal a wound in Might, Speed, Focus or Conviction (not Health) between scenes, if:\n\n* You have access to some form of first aid, either from a player having the First Aid skill at proficient or higher, or a piece of technology. AND\n\n* Your health attribute is not wounded AND\n\n* You forego refreshing pools between scenes.\n\nSo, if you have multiple core attribute wounds, they can take multiple days to heal. Some high-tech gear can speed that healing rate. \n\nTaking a wound to Health represents a brush with death - significant organ damage, blood loss, and so on. You cannot heal a wound to Health naturally - instead, someone with the appropriate Empowerment and Healing ability must heal you. \n\nAt the end of each day that a character with a Health wound does not receive medical attention, make a health defense check with a target equal to the number of days since the attribute was wounded. Note that this roll will have a hindrance (due to the wound), and that failure will require taking another wound, resulting in death.\n\n# Creating a Character\n\n1. Set your four primary attribute maximum pools to 5. Distribute 10 additional points to those attributes as you see fit.\n\n2. Your initial refresh rate for your attributes is:\n\n    1. 1 if the max pool is 5\n\n    2. 2 if the max pool is 6-10\n\n    3. 3 if the max pool is 11-15 \n\n3. Select one attribute to have edge 1, the rest have edge of 0.\n\n4. Set your health attribute to 10, and your health defense skill to proficient.\n\n5. Select 4 skills (combat or non-combat) to be proficient in. Select 4 skills to be inept in. The remainder, you are unskilled.\n\n6. Start with 10 XP, you can spend those points on any upgrades without needing to meet requirements.\n\n# Advancement\n\nTo advance your character, spend Experience Points (XP). You will gain XP during gameplay sessions, for achieving goals, character development, defeating foes, and general quality gameplay.\n\nEach non-basic Upgrade has a cost, most also have requirements and discounts. Requirements are largely met during gameplay and represent conditions that might lead a character to gain particular insight into actions or abilities. \n\nSpecial Requirement Rules:\n\n* Requirements for Upgrades can also be bypassed by receiving training from a master or other in-game mechanism. Characters can also train each other, at the GM's discretion (typically the character doing the training needs to be highly capable in the ability in question).\n\n* Requirements for Upgrades are ignored during character creation. It is assumed that your character received training or had the experience necessary to buy the abilities they start with.\n\n* Upgrade requirements in the form of counters (Participate in five combat scenes, etc) reset to zero whenever an upgrade with that requirement is purchased. Thus, you need to use rapid strike twenty times to go from Rapid Strike 1 to 2, and an additional twenty times to go from Rapid Strike 2 to Whirlwind Strike.\n\n* Some Upgrades have numbers in their name, but are referred to in requirements text without a number. That is intentional - any use of any of the numbered abilities in that case would  meet the requirements. Thus, it is possible to bypass Rapid Strike 2 and go straight from Rapid Strike 1 to Whirlwind Strike.\n\n## Basic Upgrades\n\nUnlike other upgrades listed below, Basic Upgrades have no prerequisites, nor do they offer any category discounts.\n\n**+1 to any Attribute's maximum pool**: cost is floor(max_pool / 5) + 3. Note that increasing the pool may also increase the baseline refresh value for the attribute. *ex: Increasing might pool from 4 to 5 costs 3 points, but from 11 to 12 costs 5.*\n\n**+1 edge in any Attribute**: New total edge in all four attributes, squared. Ex: You already have 2 Might edge and 1 Focus edge, to gain 1 Concentration edge would be 16 points.\n\n## Upgrade Costs\n\nUnless otherwise noted, Upgrade Costs are determined by their tier level. Don’t forget the discounts below!\n\n* Tier 1: 5 XP\n\n* Tier 2: 8 XP\n\n* Tier 3: 12 XP\n\n* Tier 4: 17 XP\n\n* Tier 5: 25 XP\n\n* Tier 6: 40 XP\n\n## Discounts\n\nAll non-basic Upgrades are organized by discipline and tier level, representing the (roughly) increasing power and utility of the Upgrade in a certain area of growth. When buying an Upgrade, the XP cost actually paid is the listed cost of the Upgrade, minus the tier value of all other Upgrades in the same category that are at a lower tier than the Upgrade being purchased.\n\nExample: An advanced infiltrator wants to purchase a tier 4 ability in the Sneaking category. This ability has a base cost of 17 XP, but that infiltrator already has three tier 1 abilities (1 point discount each), two tier 2 abilities (2 each), and a tier 3 ability (all in the Sneaking category). The total discount is 10, so the character must pay 7 XP to purchase that Upgrade. Note that even if the character had other tier 4 or above Upgrades in that category, they do not count towards the discount value.\n\n## Skill Affinities\n\nEach upgrade category has zero or more skill affinities associated with it, such as the Survival category's affinity for the Swimming and Movement skills. Upgrades in that category will improve a character's proficiency with that skill and will also give additional uses for the skill itself.\n\n## Using Upgrades\n\nMost Upgrades give your character new abilities they can use with skill checks. The check might be persuading someone or attacking someone, or hacking a computer. Without these Upgrades, your character can only do the most basic things. For example: no matter how high the Medicine roll, a character without the Surgeon upgrade cannot replace a spleen.\n\nThe abilities granted from an Upgrade sometimes have a cost associated with them. This cost must be paid from an [appropriate](#heading=h.py74nbio7gt2) pool, and this pool is fixed once the character starts taking Upgrades within a category. If the pool cost is given as an attribute (Might 2), that's what needs to be paid. If the cost is given with a P value (P 2), then select the appropriate pool and pay the cost. This cost must be paid before making any skill checks (so the pool is spent even if the check is a failure).\n\nUsing abilities granted by Upgrades also takes time. That is represented as an initiative cost (I) on the ability. An ability with I:4 takes 4 ticks as an action to use. Abilities can also have the **interrupt, extended, **or **hold** keywords that affect timing.\n\nMany upgrades provide some kind of bonus, either situational edge or an asset on rolls. Unless otherwise noted, multiple sources of situational edge do not stack, and a player can only have up to two assets on any given check.\n\n## Upgrade Keywords\n\nMany upgrades have keywords, which specialize the type or specify common rules. When an upgrade has a type keyword, only apply other upgrades with that type keyword where the types match as discounts or requirements to future upgrades. For example, Power Strike 1 (axe), cannot be used to provide a discount or prerequisite for Debilitating Strike: Stun (unarmed).\n\n### Type Keywords\n\nWeapon: When taking this upgrade, specify a weapon skill.\n\nTradition: When taking this upgrade, specify a Magic Tradition (Arcane, Religion, Psionic). Abilities related to this upgrade apply only to this type. This upgrade can be taken once per Tradition.\n\n### Other Keywords\n\nStrike: When attacking someone or something, a character can only use one Strike power.\n\nShield: Upgrades with this keyword require the character to be using a shield to activate it.\n\nMelee: This upgrade can only be used with Melee weapons.\n\nRanged: This upgrade can only be used with Ranged weapons.\n\nMedicine: Every time a character is the target of an upgrade with the Medicine keyword, they receive a medicine hindrance that applies to all future rolls. These hindrances reset daily and are tracked per character (so multiple characters with medicine all share hindrances on the same target). Using abilities with the Medicine keyword that do not require a medicine check still apply the hindrance for future checks. Medicine hindrances are applied after the ability is activated.\n\nStacks: Most upgrades do not stack with each other (if someone has Run Fast Legs +2 and purchases Run Fast Legs +3, they get +3 on their movement rolls, not +5). Multiple upgrades with the Stacks keyword, however, can stack. \n\n## Attacking\n\n**Skill Affinities**: Bashing, Fencing, Righteous Fury, Combat Insight, Hurling, Quick Draw (AI: rename this), Hip Shot, Sniper\n\n### Tier 1\n\nSkill Affinity: Become proficient in one of the skills with an affinity for this discipline. **Requirement**: successfully use that skill 20 times.\n\nUnarmed Strike (Weapon - Unarmed) - You can strike foes with your hand, feet, and face.

The difference between a companion and a trained animal is:\n\n* Under normal circumstances, a companion only responds to commands given by its owner.\n\n* Companions can be given much more complex commands than trained animals. Trained animals can guard something, companions will wake their owners under specific circumstances. Trained animals can attack someone, companions can go scout an area and retrieve something small.\n\n* Owners gain +4 edge when making command animal checks to command their companion.\n\n* Companion animals have access to a Loyalty pool, which can be spent like PC attribute pools to adjust the animal's rolls, and a Health pool instead of hit points. \n\n* Companion animals can wound their Loyalty and Health pools before dying (and are therefore more resilient than trained animals).\n\n* In order to gain a companion, the character must take one of the companion upgrades. They can only have one such companion, unless they take the Additional Companion upgrade.\n\nIf a player's companion dies or is dismissed, that character can gain a new companion (and upgrade it) from the tier and upgrade lists that have already been spent on the companion without spending additional experience points, through normal gameplay.\n\nSkill Affinities: Movement, Swimming, Wilderness Lore, Command Animal, Perception, Riding\n\n### Tier 1\n\nEndurance: Choose an attribute. Gain +1 refresh in that attribute. **Requirement**: refresh that attribute pool 20 times. Special: can be taken multiple times, but the requirement counter resets each time the upgrade is selected.\n\nTrain Animal: You are proficient in training new companions. If you capture a wild animal (or somehow steal someone else's companion), you can spend time training it. Every day you spend with the animal, make a Command Animal check against the animal's Ornery score (modified situationally by the GM). If you succeed three times before you fail three times, you have befriended and trained the animal to respond to your commands. **Requirement**: participate in the training of five animals.\n\nClose Pals: Gain +3 edge on making Command Animal checks to command an animal you have personally trained. This stacks with the companion bonus, but is more useful with regular trained animals. **Requirement**: train five animals. \n\nCompanion Ability: Train your companion in a new ability. **Requirement**: The companion must meet the requirements of the new ability, the ability must be on its species list, and either you or someone else must possess the Train Animal ability and spend one day training the animal.\n\nSkill Affinity: Become proficient in one of the skills with an affinity for this discipline. **Requirement**: successfully use that skill 20 times.\n\nAnimal Insight (I:4): Make a command animal check against an animal's ornery score. Success means you can tell the animal's motivation, status, and hostility.\n\nAnimal Companion: You gain an animal companion from the basic tier list. \n\n### Tier 2\n\nWild Ability: Train your companion in a new ability. **Requirement**: The companion must meet the requirements of the new ability, and you must possess the Train Animal ability and spend one day training the animal. \n\nFriend to Animals: You gain +4 edge on all interactions with animals that are not your companion.\n\nMotivate Animal (P:2, I:2 interrupt) - Give any companion animal (not necessarily your own) +1 on any roll.\n\nTracking (P:1) - Make a Wilderness Lore check, you can attempt to identify and follow the tracks of a creature that has been nearby.\n\nMounted Artillery - When mounted on your animal, you gain +3 edge to all ranged attack checks. **Requirement**: Shoot from animal-back at least twenty times.\n\n### Tier 3\n\nSkill Affinity: Become trained in one of the skills with an affinity for this discipline. **Requirement**: successfully use that skill 20 times, proficient in that skill.\n\nCommand Animal: Become expert in Command Animal. **Requirement**: Successfully use Command Animal on at least 20 different animals.\n\nMimic Animal: (I:4) - Make a Wet Science Knowledge check. You mimic an animal's vocalizations. You could call an animal to you, scare it off, or try to convince humans that animals of some type are nearby. The target of the check is usually the mental defense of whatever person or animal you are trying to fool with your mimicry.\n\nAdditional companion: You can gain an additional companion from any tier list that is available to you.\n\nAdvanced Companion: You gain an animal companion from the advanced tier list (NYI). \n\n### Tier 4\n\nFalse Friend (I:4, P:4) - You can command someone else's companion. Make an opposed command roll against the other owner. If you succeed by at least the other companion's Ornery, you can give it an order.\n\n### Tier 5\n\nSkill Affinity: Become expert in one of the skills with an affinity for this discipline. **Requirement**: successfully use that skill 20 times, proficient in that skill.\n\nAnimal Slayer (P:5, I:10 delayed): On any animal you have successfully used the Animal Insight ability on, make an attack. If the attack hits, the animal is killed outright.\n\n### Tier 6\n\nEpic Companion: Gain an animal companion from the Epic tier list (NYI).\n\n## Knowing and Making Things\n\n**Note**: **Gadgets **are like **gizmos **([ref](#heading=h.dvhb3nxqu5p9)), but are further limited here. Gadgets (without the Tier 3 ability Lend Gadget) can only be used by their creator. Furthermore, the assumption is that the creator has a collection of materials and ingredients on hand and usually assembles things in the moment to create the gadget itself (so you cannot pre-create the gadget and use it later at a reduced pool / initiative cost). If the player is separated from their supplies, their ability to make gadgets will be reduced. \n\n**Skill Affinities**: Arcane Knowledge, Arcane Tinker, Religious Knowledge, Religious Tinker, Psionic Knowledge, Psionic Tinker, Alchemical Knowledge, Alchemical Tinker, Other Knowledge, Other Tinker, Wilderness Lore\n\n### Tier 1\n\nIdentify Magic (Tradition): +4 edge on actions to identify a magic item\n\nSkill in a bottle (Tradition): Select three skills from any list. You have a gadget that can grant proficiency in that skill for one scene. I:6 P:3 to activate.\n\nSkill Affinity: Become proficient in one of the skills with an affinity for this discipline. **Requirement**: successfully use that skill 20 times.\n\n### Tier 2\n\nDetect Magic (Tradition): Find nearby technological artifacts. +4 edge on search checks to find magic\n\nAbility in a bottle (Tradition): when taking this ability, choose any ability from any other list at a tier below this one. You have a gadget that replicates this power. The gadget lasts a maximum of one scene.

A magic-focused player character in Tales is a student of magic, aspiring to wizardhood, and not a Wizard with Gandalf-tier powers. Do not expect to have the breadth of power that a typical Dungeons and Dragons character has. Instead, many forms of magic are much more specialized - a character might have arcane tattoos that provide defense and a steady supply of potions that grant fire breathing, rather than a spellbook with all the basic spells.\n\nIn this game there are three schools of magic: Arcane, Religion, and Psionic. They differ largely by flavor rather than mechanics, although Arcane magic tends to use Focus whereas Religion uses Conviction and Psionics uses a mix. Any upgrade tagged with **Tradition** must select one of those three when chosen, and the in-category discount and requirement counting treat different traditions as completely different (you cannot work towards a Religion upgrade by using Psionic magic. Below, the language \"cast a spell\" is usually used to mean any tradition of magic.\n\nThere is a lot of overlap between the three traditions, and in part the choice of which to follow is one of flavor for your character - do they serve a higher power, or are they drawing their energy from within? There are, however, a few tradition-specific features to help differentiate.\n\nYou will notice that there are not many actual spells listed in this book. Most spells are mysterious and rare things - your characters will find them in treasure hoards and dusty libraries, and the GM will make descriptions available as the spells become available. Only starting spells are listed below.\n\n### Spellcasting\n\nIn order to actually cast a spell, a character must have the relevant tradition upgrade to allow casting spells of that tier, and access to the spell itself. Spells are treated like treasures in this game - a tome of arcane lore, a prayer book, or a focusing crystal would have in it the instructions to cast some spells. If the player has the right upgrades, they can use that treasure to cast that spell. Other upgrades in the Magic discipline can be used to permanently add a spell to a character's repertoire, or to improve specific spells.\n\nCasting a spell from equipment has a base initiative cost of 6E, representing the act of finding the right part of the instructions in the book to begin casting the spell. Each spell further has an initiative cost, which is added to that base. Spells memorized by the character just use their regular initiative cost, since they are cast from memory and do not require reading instructions. Otherwise, spellcasting is treated much like any other skill check in the game.\n\n1. The character acts on their initiative tick and declares their action as casting a spell. All decisions for the spell's casting are made now - mainly the level at which the spell is cast (many have variable costs that change the power and difficulty of the spell).\n\n2. Spellcasting is an extended action, so the character then waits until the appropriate initiative tick to resolve the spell. Remember that any pool spent during the extended action increases the initiative cost of the action (if you spend 4 pool dodging an attack, your spell resolves 4 ticks later than it would have), and taking a wound during this phase causes the action to cancel, and your character can act again as normal two ticks after they take the wound.\n\n3. If the spell has a specific target, choose it at this point. This will adjust the difficulty of casting the spell and may apply assets or hindrances to the casting. Resolve the success check for casting the spell using the Tinker skill relevant to your tradition.\n\n4. If the spell is successful, it takes effect. This may have an immediate effect, or in the case of a combat-oriented spell it will give you an opportunity to make a melee or ranged attack as your next action. (so spells like firebolt are relatively easy to cast, but also require a follow-up attack roll using a ranged weapon skill of your choice to actually hit the target with the fire).\n\n**Skill Affinities**: Arcane Knowledge, Arcane Tinker, Religious Knowledge, Religious Tinker, Psionic Knowledge, Psionic Tinker \n\nSpecial Keywords:\n\n**Element **- Choose an element when selecting this power. Upgrades of this type can be chosen multiple times, with a different element each time, but only matching element upgrades count for future discounts.\n\n**X** - Many spells have variable effects, and show an X:[A-B] label - choose a number between A and B (inclusive) when you begin casting. The cost and effect is derived from this. Remember that any Initiative cost that is 0 or less is treated as 1, but the calculated damage value can be negative, meaning that a large margin of success is needed to deal damage.\n\n**Spell **- Using these abilities counts as casting a spell for calculating prerequisites or activating other effects.\n\n### Tier 1\n\nSkill Affinity: Become proficient in one of the skills with an affinity for this discipline. **Requirement**: successfully use that skill 20 times.\n\nUnlock Spells (Tradition): Gain the ability to cast any tier 1 spells you find. **Requirement**: Make at least 15 successful Tinker skills in your tradition.\n\nElemental Dart (Spell, Element, Tradition): I:XE, P:X, X:[0-3].

That equipment has a **depletion** value, with several modifiers. Normally, when your character activates a gizmo, roll 1d12, and try to roll the depletion value or higher. If you roll below the depletion value, the gizmo still works, but this is the last time it will work. Some gizmos can be recharged or repaired, but often once it depletes, it's scrap.\n\nGizmos may be **reliable** or **unreliable**. Reliable gizmos gain an asset on their depletion roll, and unreliable ones gain a hindrance.\n\nExample: After firing a blaster with depletion *4 (reliable)*, roll 2d12 and keep the highest. If that number is 4+, the blaster is fine. Otherwise, it becomes unusable after firing.\n\n## Other Equipment\n\nThis is really just a starter list. No prices either. We'll work out what you start with, and then what stuff costs over time.\n\nStatistics Key: I: initiative cost to use, D: base damage, R: reload initiative cost, S: shots per reload\n\n<table>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Item</td>\n    <td>Statistics</td>\n    <td>Description</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>WEAPONS</td>\n    <td></td>\n    <td></td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Light Weapons (Speed and Focus)</td>\n    <td></td>\n    <td></td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Dagger</td>\n    <td>I:4, D:1</td>\n    <td></td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Rapier</td>\n    <td>I:4, D:2</td>\n    <td></td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Light Mace</td>\n    <td>I:4, D:2</td>\n    <td>A stick with a painful spiky ball affixed.</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Quarterstaff</td>\n    <td>I:6, D:2</td>\n    <td>Whap you on the head with my stick.</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Crossbow</td>\n    <td>I:2, D:5, R:6E, S:1  </td>\n    <td>Aim action: I:5E, remove 1 range hindrance.

For ten minutes, you can connect with your companion and view the world through their eyes. I:4 to initiate.  \n\n### Bone Breaker\n\nYour companion has an asset on using their tail (or other body part or augmentation) to crush or smash an object, such as a wall, building, locked door, machine, or boulder. If Bone Breaker is used on a living creature, it does 1 additional point of damage and staggers the creature, causing them to lose their next turn.  I:6\n\n### Defensive\n\nYour companion gains +1 on defense rolls. Stacks.\n\n### Hands\n\nEither bio-engineered or cybernetic, your companion has fully-articulated grasping hands with opposable thumbs. They can pick up and manipulate objects, open doors, carry things. They still are not particularly intelligent (so no real tool use), but they can be relied upon to hold flashlights or fetch something.\n\n### Look At Me\n\nThrough some trick of sound, movement, technology, or special enhancements, your companion distracts and confuses foes. The foe is dazzled for one round, giving the foe a 2 point penalty on all actions. Each time you take this ability, you can choose to increase by one either the number of foes you attempt to dazzle or increase the penalty by another 2 points, but not both. You must choose at the time you take the ability. I:2\n\n### Masterful Attack\n\nGain an asset on attack rolls.\n\n### Morale Booster\n\nJust having your companion around makes everyone feel happier, healthier, and more relaxed. During rests, your companion puts friends, comrades, and companions at ease so much that they recover 1 extra pool of their choice between scenes. This ability stacks with Improved Rest, but the party can only benefit from one Morale Booster per rest. \n\n### Ranged Attack\n\nThese types of attacks are almost never natural, but companions can be enchanted to blast out ranged damage. A ranged attack does 2 points of damage to creatures within long range. Each time you take this ability, your companion does 2 additional points of damage. I:6 \n\n### Pin\n\nYour companion holds down prey with their body or claws, attacking it for 2 points of damage. The prey is immobilized, unable to attack until it is released. Each time you take this ability, your companion does an additional 2 points of damage and holds the prey for an additional round. I:Special - The pin lasts until the prey's next action, at which point the prey can attempt to escape (I:4, Physical). Failure to escape means the prey suffers damage again and remains pinned.\n\n### Scout\n\nYour companion’s tracking, seeking, and searching skills are well honed. You can send your companion ahead or behind you, up to a mile away, and ask them to find a person, scout out a place, search for time anomalies, or do some other thing. You and your companion have a special way of communicating the details of your companion’s discoveries to each other, perhaps through implanted technology, hand signals, or some other type of connection. \n\n### Skilled\n\nYour companion gains one relevant skill at the proficient level.\n\n### Stampede\n\nYour companion runs at or through one or more foes within long range, sending them sprawling. All living creatures within immediate distance of your companion’s trajectory are stunned for one round. I:8\n\n### Sturdy Mount\n\nYour companion is trained, equipped, and (if necessary) enhanced in some way so that they can carry a rider. If this ability is taken more than once, it adds an additional rider each time.\n\n### Swift Healer\n\nYour companion has a natural or enhanced ability to heal, gaining 1 additional point of health between scenes.    \n\n### Sniff Magic\n\nYour companion gains an asset when searching an area for magic items.\n\n### Terrify\n\nYour companion is terrifying. Either as an attack action with no damage done (I:6) or for free when any foe sees your companion damage someone, any foes of the companion become shaken, with a 2 point penalty to all checks. \n\n### Uncanny Skill\n\nYour companion has learned (or had implanted into their neural system) a skill that is not normally available to animal-kind. Choose one of: moving, swimming, sneaking, legerdemain, first aid, perception, sense motive, intimidate. Your companion is now proficient in that skill. If this ability is taken more than once, it can be used to upgrade the skill to trained / expert, or to add additional skills. Note that some skills likely require the Hands ability to be fully effective.\n\n### Well-armored\n\nYou have worked hard to ensure that your companion is protected from predators, foes, and natural disasters. Either through training, body modification, or additional equipment, your companion gains +2 to Armor. \n\n# Conditions\n\nWhen a condition is listed as having a modifier on difficulty scores, that is given assuming the target of the condition is a PC. For example, *dazed* raises all difficulties by 2, so a PC who was attempting a DC 4 task would now need to succeed at DC 6 instead. If the condition is applied to an NPC, all of the NPCs DCs are reduced by that amount when PCs attempt to act against them. If attacking a dazed opponent whose defense started at 5, the DC to attack is lowered to 3.\n\nDazed: a dazed character is temporarily unable to bring all their faculties to bear. Increase all difficulties for that character by two.\n\nStunned: a stunned character cannot act in any way for some number of initiative ticks.\n\nCrippled arm: drop whatever was in the arm, can make no other actions with that arm. \n\nCrippled leg: speed halved, cannot run.\n\n# Spells\n\nMagic is mysterious and stuff, but nonetheless here's a by-no-means exhaustive list of spells and their tier levels.\n\nMagic Missive: 1\n\nSpeak to Plants: 1\n\nUncontrollable Flatulence: 1\n\nInvisibility: 1\n\nCreate Newt Servant: 2\n\nEnthrall Mindless Creature: 2\n\nMembranous Inconvenience: 2\n\nReveal Location: 2\n\nListen to Plants: 2\n\nHell's Mandibles: 3\n\nSummon Chaos Minion: 3\n\nPoisonous Aura: 3\n\nPolymorph: 3\n\nDeath's Breath: 3\n\nDetonate Brain: 4\n\nExtract Living Essence: 6\n",
